# Unity Application for Neurorehabilitation in Collaborative VR

The VR application for the neurorehabilitation of people who have lost the ability to move their hands for various reasons. The application allows connection to a server for collaborative neurorehabilitation, offering two roles: therapist or patient. The therapist assigns tasks that the patient observes through virtual reality animations. The patient then tries to repeat the movements seen, which helps in recovering motor function. This interactive and immersive approach makes the rehabilitation process more effective.
